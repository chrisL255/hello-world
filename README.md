Simple Github learning project

Hi I am Chris and I tutor mathematics on-line. I am am also interested in software development having developed some c# based VSTO systems for a charity with which I was involved for several years. I have set myself a challenge for 2021 to write a scrabble games app for an iPhone so have started by investigating Xamarin.
I had recently upgraded my VS to 2019 which encourages the iuse of GitHub. So as part of the investigation I decided to use GitHub as the remote repository for my initial Xamarin training apps rather than azure-devops. That led me here!
